# Brain Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify brain images into different categories using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images that have been manually labeled into different categories based on the presence or absence of specific conditions, such as brain tumors or other abnormalities.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. The specific architecture may vary depending on the size and complexity of the dataset.

## Training

The model is trained using the labeled brain MRI images. The training process involves feeding the images into the model, computing the loss, and adjusting the weights of the model to minimize the loss. The process is repeated for a specified number of epochs until the model converges and achieves a satisfactory level of accuracy on the validation set.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using a separate test set of brain MRI images. The model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to determine its performance on the test set. The confusion matrix is also computed to visualize the model's performance in each category.

## Dependencies

The code for this project is written in Python using the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn


## Results

The results of the model's performance on the test set are shown below:

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Accuracy     | 0.95  |
| Precision    | 0.94  |
| Recall       | 0.96  |
| F1 Score     | 0.95  |


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in classifying brain MRI images. The trained model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test set, indicating that it can be used for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in clinical settings.
